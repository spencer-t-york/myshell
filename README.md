## Need to add the following functionality:
1. Use `dup()` instead of `dup2()`.
2. Use Execv instead of Execvp.
3. Need to implement support for `path`, `path +`, or `path -` commands.
4. Need to implement support for `<`, `>` commands and combined redirection.

I believe that is all we need to add at the moment.
